Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration: August 15, 2023, 09:30 AM - August 15, 2023, 12:45 PM (UTC)

Impact: The user authentication service experienced intermittent downtime, causing login failures and delayed access for approximately 20% of users.

Root Cause:

The outage was caused by an unexpected surge in database connections due to a misconfigured database connection pool setting. This led to database connection exhaustion and subsequently affected the authentication service's response time.

Timeline:

09:30 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for increased response times in the authentication service.
09:45 AM: Engineering team initiated investigation into the issue, suspecting a potential network or hardware problem.
10:15 AM: Initial investigations found no issues with hardware or network. Focus shifted to application-level components.
10:45 AM: Misleading investigation occurred, as the team suspected a recent code deployment was responsible. Rollback was attempted, but the issue persisted.
11:15 AM: Incident escalated to the database team as response times continued to degrade.
11:45 AM: Database team identified the misconfigured connection pool settings and their impact on database connections.
12:00 PM: Configuration settings were corrected, and database connections were gradually released.
12:45 PM: Service fully restored, response times normalized, and user authentication issues resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfigured database connection pool allowed a significantly higher number of concurrent connections than anticipated. This led to connection exhaustion and degraded performance in the authentication service.

Resolution: The connection pool settings were adjusted to align with the service's capacity requirements. Additionally, monitoring was enhanced to trigger alerts for abnormal database connection usage.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Implement automated monitoring and alerting for database connection pool usage.
Enhance deployment procedures to include thorough configuration validation before production releases.
Establish clear communication channels between application and database teams to expedite issue resolution.
Tasks:

Adjust database connection pool settings to appropriate levels based on service requirements.
Develop and deploy automated tests for database connection pool configurations.
Conduct a comprehensive review of application-level monitoring and alerts to ensure timely issue detection.
This incident highlighted the critical importance of properly configuring and monitoring database connection pools. By addressing the misconfiguration and implementing monitoring improvements, we have taken steps to prevent similar outages in the future. We appreciate the swift collaboration between teams and the dedication shown in resolving this incident promptly.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused to our users and remain committed to delivering a seamless experience on our platform.

Lessons Learned:

Thoroughly review and validate configuration changes before deployment to prevent misconfigurations from impacting production.
Establish clear escalation paths and communication channels between teams to expedite issue resolution.
Prioritize comprehensive monitoring and alerting mechanisms to quickly identify and address anomalies in critical services.
We will continue to learn from incidents like these to further strengthen our system's reliability and provide a resilient user experience. Thank you for your understanding and support.
